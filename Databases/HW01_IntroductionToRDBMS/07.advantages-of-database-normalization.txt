Advantages of database normalization
====================================

1. The database does not have redundant data, it is smaller in size so less money need to be spend on storage.

2. Because there is less data to search through, it is much faster to run a query on the data.

3. Because there is no data duplication there is better data integrity and less risk of mistakes.

4. Once change can be made which can instantly be cascaded across any related records.

5. Searching, sorting, and creating indexes is faster, since tables are narrower, and more rows fit on a data page.

6. Index searching is often faster, since indexes tend to be narrower and shorter.

7. More tables allow better use of segments to control physical placement of data.

8. Triggers execute more quickly if you are not maintaining redundant data.

9. Data modification anomalies are reduced.

10. Normalization is conceptually cleaner and easier to maintain and change as your needs change.
