Integrity constraints
=====================

Before one can start to implement the database tables, one must define the integrity constraints. Intergrity means something like 'be right' and consistent. The data in a database must be right and in good condition.

There are the domain integrity, the entity integrity, the referential integrity and the foreign key integrity constraints. 

1. Domain integrity
-------------------
Domain integrity means the definition of a valid set of values for an attribute. You define
- data type,
- lenght or size
- is null value allowed
- is the value unique or not
for an attribute.

These definitions ensure that a specific attribute will have a right and proper value in the database.

2. Entity integrity
-------------------
The entity integrity constraint states that primary keys can't be null. There must be a proper value in the primary key field.

This is because the primary key value is used to identify individual rows in a table. If there were null values for primary keys, it would mean that we could not indentify those rows.

3. Referential Integrity Constraint
-----------------------------------
The referential integrity constraint is specified between two tables and it is used to maintain the consistency among rows between the two tables.

The rules are:
1. You can't delete a record from a primary table if matching records exist in a related table.
2. You can't change a primary key value in the primary table if that record has related records.
3. You can't enter a value in the foreign key field of the related table that doesn't exist in the primary key of the primary table.
4. However, you can enter a Null value in the foreign key, specifying that the records are unrelated.

4. Foreign Key Integrity Constraint
-----------------------------------
There are two foreign key integrity constraints: cascade update related fields and cascade delete related rows. These constraints affect the referential integrity constraint.

- Cascade Update Related Fields

Any time you change the primary key of a row in the primary table, the foreign key values are updated in the matching rows in the related table. This constraint overrules rule 2 in the referential integrity constraints. 

- Cascade Delete Related Rows

Any time you delete a row in the primary table, the matching rows are automatically deleted in the related table. This constraint overrules rule 1 in the referential integrity constraints.
