SQL
===

SQL is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).

Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL consists of a data definition language and a data manipulation language. The scope of SQL includes data insert, query, update and delete, schema creation and modification, and data access control. Although SQL is often described as, and to a great extent is, a declarative language (4GL), it also includes procedural elements.

The SQL language is subdivided into several language elements, including:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Clauses, which are constituent components of statements and queries. (In some cases, these are optional.)

- Expressions, which can produce either scalar values, or tables consisting of columns and rows of data

- Predicates, which specify conditions that can be evaluated to SQL three-valued logic (3VL) (true/false/unknown) or Boolean truth values and are used to limit the effects of statements and queries, or to change program flow.

- Queries, which retrieve the data based on specific criteria. This is an important element of SQL.

- Statements, which may have a persistent effect on schemata and data, or may control transactions, program flow, connections, sessions, or diagnostics.

- SQL statements also include the semicolon (";") statement terminator. Though not required on every platform, it is defined as a standard part of the SQL grammar.

- Insignificant whitespace is generally ignored in SQL statements and queries, making it easier to format SQL code for readability.

Example SQL query:
------------------

SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE id > 10 ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 50
