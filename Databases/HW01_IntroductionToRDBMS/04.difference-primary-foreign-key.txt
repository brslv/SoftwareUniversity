Differences between primary and foreign keys
============================================

What is primary key:
--------------------
A primary key is a special relational database table column (or combination of columns) designated to uniquely identify all table records. A primary key column cannot be null. Most tables should have a primary key, and each table can have only ONE primary key. We need as a way to keep the integrity of the relational database system and to be sure no two exact same rows exist.

What is foreign key:
--------------------
In the context of relational databases, a foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table. In simpler words, the foreign key is defined in a second table, but it refers to the primary key in the first table. Its main purpose is to identify a particular row of the referenced table.

4 Main differences:
-------------------
1. Unlike the primary, the foreign key can be NULL.
2. Foreign key can be duplicate, opposite to primary key, which is always unique.
3. Foreign key mostly work as link between two table when we join tables using INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN.
4. Name of foreign key in one table can be different than the name of the primary key it represents in another table.
