What is T-SQL
=============

T-SQL (Transact-SQL) is a set of programming extensions from Sybase and Microsoft that add several features to the Structured Query Language (SQL) including transaction control, exception and error handling, row processing, and declared variables.

In T-SQL you can also write stored procedures: pieces of code residing on the server to manage complex business rules that are hard or impossible to manage with pure set-based operations.

It's mostly used in MS SQL Server.
