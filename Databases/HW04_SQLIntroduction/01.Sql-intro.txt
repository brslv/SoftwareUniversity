What is SQL
===========

SQL is the alias for Structured Query Language - a computer language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in/from relational database systems (RDBMS's).

Different database systems may use a slightly different SQL than the normal SQL (SQL dialect). There are these most common SQL dialects:
	- MS SQL uses T-SQL
	- Oracle uses PL/SQL
	- MS Access uses JET SQL

SQL's role in the database world:
	- Allows users to acces data in RDBMS
	- Allows users to describe the data
	- Allows them to manipulate that data
	- Plays the role of a bridge between the application and the database server
	- Allows the users to manipulate tables, to create and drop them.
	- Allows the users to set permissions

What is DML
===========
DML (or Data Manipulation Language) statements are used to work with the data in tables. There are four base commands (CRUD):
	- SELECT
	- INSERT
	- UPDATE
	- DELETE

What is DDL
===========
DDL (or Data Definition Language) statements are used to build and modify the structure of your tables and other objects in the database.
	- CREATE
	- ALTER
	- DROP
