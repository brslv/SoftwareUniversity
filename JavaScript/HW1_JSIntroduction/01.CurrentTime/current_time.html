		<h1>Instructions</h1>
		<p>
			This simple program should be ran in Node.js. To do this, first install <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>. When you're done, open up a console/terminal, navigate to the folder <em>/HW1_JSIntroduction/01.CurrentTime/</em> and run the command <strong>'node current_time.js'</strong>. You should see the current date and time, neatly formated. :)
			</p>
		<p>
			If you don't want to mess with Node, you can view the result in your browser's console. Just hit F12 and open the 'Console' tab.
