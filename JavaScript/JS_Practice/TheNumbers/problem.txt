"The numbers, Mason, what do they mean?"
We’ve just received a ton of unreadable signals from the International Space Station. We've lost all contact with the team up there, and all we got are these messages. Aliens? Might be. Can you please clear up the messages for us, so we can pass them to the decryption team?

Your job is to clear the text from any unnecessary symbols (only the numbers are needed) and convert the remaining number sequences to hex format. If a hex value has less than 4 characters, you need to add leading zeros. Finally, you need to place a "0x" prefix before each hex value and concatenate them all with dashes '-'. 

For example, we have the following message: "5tffwj(//*7837xzc2---34rlxXP%$". After trimming the unnecessary data (non-numeric characters), we've got the numbers 5, 7837, 2 and 34 left. We convert them to hex: 5, 1E9D, 2, 22; add leading zeros where needed: 0005, 1E9D, 0002, 0022, place 0x before each one and conc	atenate them with dashes: 0x0005-0x1E9D-0x0002-0x0022. 
(Note: hex values MUST be uppercase)

Input
The input data will be received as an array. It contains one argument – the initial message you need to transform.
The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.

Output
The output consists of only one line – the transformed message.
