Write a program that reads file information from the console and groups the files according to their extensions in the format <file-extension> <[file1, file2, â€¦ ]> <total memory in MB>, where total memory is the sum of the sizes of the respective files. For example, given the files:

sentinel .exe 15MB
zoomIt .msi 3MB
skype .exe 45MB
trojanStopper .bat 23MB
kindleInstaller .exe 120MB
setup .msi 33.4MB
winBlock .bat 1MB

The result should be:
.bat [trojanStopper, winBlock] 24MB
.msi [setup, zoomIt] 36.4MB
.exe [kindleInstaller, sentinel, skype] 180MB

Extension lines should be sorted by the extension names. The files themselves should also be ordered alphabetically. Finally, the information is converted to JSON format and printed:
{".bat":{"files":["trojanStopper","winBlock"],"memory":"24.00"},".exe":{"files":["kindleInstaller","sentinel","skype"],"memory":"180.00"},".msi":{"files":["setup","zoomIt"],"memory":"36.40"}}

Input
The input is passed to the first JavaScript function found in your code as array of several strings: each string will contain information about a file in the format <name> <extension> <memory>, separated by spaces. 
The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.

Output
Print the file information in JSON format as shown in the examples. The memory should be printed with 2 places after the decimal point.
