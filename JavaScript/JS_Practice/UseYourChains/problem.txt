You are in Cherny Vit now and there are 12km to Anchova Bichkiya Hut. You need to get there by car. But there is so much snow that you need to use car chains. In order to put them on the wheels correctly, you need to read the manual. But it is encrypted…

As input you will receive an HTML document as a single string. You need to get the text from all the <p> tags and replace all characters which are not small letters and numbers with a space " ". After that you must decrypt the text – all letters from a to m are converted to letters from n to z accordingly (a -> n; b -> o; … m -> z). The letters from n to z are converted to letters from a to m accordingly (n -> a; o -> b; … z -> m). All multiple spaces should then be replaced by only one space.
For example, if we have "<div>Santa</div><p>znahny # grkg ()&^^^&12</p>" we extract "znahny # grkg ()&^^^&12". Every character that is not a small letter or a number is replaced with a space ("znahny grkg       12"). We convert each small letter as described above ("znahny grkg       12" -> "manual text       12") and replace all multiple spaces with only one space ("manual text 12"). Finally, we concatenate the decrypted text from all <p></p> tags (in this case, it's only one). And there you go – you have the manual ready to read!

Input
The input is passed to the first JavaScript function found in your code as array that has one element – the string with the HTML document.
The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.

Output
Print at a single line the decrypted text of the manual. See the given examples below.
