Level 1
-------
- Java Basics Course - The second part of our "programing basics" education @ SoftUni. Started from the course "C# Basics", now we contine to explore super-interesting topics like loops, data structures, programming logic and more. All my works on these topics can be found in the "Java" folder.

- HTML/CSS Course - The second course of the first part of my education @ SoftUni. We studied some basic HTML/CSS structures and concepts such as semantic HTML5, tables, forms, layouts, CSS positioning, presentation, SASS & Less, Emmet and much more.

- JavaScript Course - In this course we were presented to the basics of the JavaScript syntax, flow control and data-structures. To be hones, I'm in love with the dynamic nature of the language, as well as the functional capabilities it offers. Maybe my favourite course by far.
